# A Lot
This is a pet project to make me use a bunch of new technologies. It is also an extremely belated present. Here is the planned setup:
1. SvelteKit Front-End
    - TailWindCSS and DaisyUI for the styling
2. Rust Back-End
    - Axum as web router
3. MongoDB
4. Docker Compose file to run it all

This is all subject to change still.

## Running
Currently\
`cd backend; cargo run`\
`cd ../frontend; npm run dev`
